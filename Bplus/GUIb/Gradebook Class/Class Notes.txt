Class Notes.txt b+ 2022-11-25
===================================================================================================
GUI get_Filename.exe is used by these bas files for getting the PE Forum - Class.txt filename.
If you have Windows you can use binary exe provided, otherwise compile your own in sub folder and
move exe up to main Gradebook folder.

Class files end with theses 9 letters Class.txt
Demo tests PE Forum - Class.txt for fun.
Just use your favorite WP and make an alphabetic list of students,
using up to 15 characters per name save it with Class.txt last 9 letters of name.

Use GUI get_FileName.exe inside app code to run a file folder browser to load a filename into
filename.txt one liner data file. Look for the ____ - Class.txt list of students we just made 
in favorite WP and use it for get_Filename.exe app called first thing in Gradebook Sketch.bas
and Gradebook Data Entry.bas.

Grades(0 To 12, 1 to 50) String Array
Use same basename PE Forum -  and then + Gradebook.dat to hold grade data.
For PE Forum - gradebook.dat I will use 0 to 13 columns
col 0 = name 15 chars right aligned
col 1 to 10  test scores 6 chars wide right aligned for 1 to 100 MUST HAVE AT LEAST 1 POINT!
col 12 ave rounded to integer of non 0 tests taken by 1 to 50 students rows

See Gradebook Sketch.bas for demo
Display 5 test score columns done randomly, totaled and averaged.

For my next trick Data Entry for the grades array, Gradebook Data Entry.bas
Creates ________ Gradebook.dat for demo it is PE Forum - Gradebook.dat made off base name of
the Class.txt file. 
Pick a class file for a list of names, start or load a basename + Gradebook.dat file
Data entry does 1 column of test scores at a time. I used random generated stuff for demo.

Selecting from a List box, first make sure you have activated the List Box when the right
line is highlighted, Right Click inside the list box, the highlighted item becomes a selected
item.

Mouse wheel is working oddly, very slowly, it no longer scrolls immdeiately to whatever line 
but keeps moving until it catches up to however many times the wheel changed. Maybe best to
click desired line or PgUp/PgDn or Home/End and then click line to hightlight, again right
click to select.

Now working with much lighter vs GUI.BM code! No need now for separate get_Filename.exe and
all the library code that entailed including Direntry.h file. Also removed from vs GUI.BM
my version of Message and Input Boxes including helper Screen State saver and restorer.

Fixed highlight bar when changed Class.txt files to line 1 and added a habdy new function
LstHighliteNum&(LstControlHandle) to tell me the index of Highlited List Item.

2022-11-29 Remove need for Direntry.k file from GUI.BI file also curPath$ ?
Hope to post 2022-11-30 with fixes.
1. The direntry.h stuff removed from BI
2. tbScore not showing first ketpresses does it need to be active? fixed, tiny change in 
   vs GUI.BM MainRouter sub.
3. scrolling is S L O W unlike other list box apps ?? fixed with major change to vs GUI.BM

2022-11-30 added a Grades table label after scrolling back to normal speeds.

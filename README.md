# What are these?

These are several QuickBASIC programs tested and fixed for QB64.

I will keep updating this repo with new stuff that I can find and fix to work with QB64.

Note:

1. Some of the "unknown" are placeholders and I will update with the correct information once I find them
2. Some of these are mildly or significantly modified to work with QB64 v2+ and may no longer work with anything else
3. If you want the original versions, then folllow the links below or search on the internet

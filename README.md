# What are these?

These are [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) ([GWBASIC](https://winworldpc.com/product/gw-basic/3x), [QBasic](https://winworldpc.com/product/qbasic/1x), [QuickBASIC](https://winworldpc.com/product/quickbasic/45), [Microsoft BASIC PDS](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-basic/pds-71), [Microsoft Visual Basic 1.0 for DOS](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-visual-bas/10-for-dos), [QB64](https://github.com/QB64Team/qb64)) programs tested and fixed for [QB64-PE](https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64pe).

1. I will update the correct information for stuff inside `UNKNOWN` as and when they become known to me
2. Some of these are mildly or significantly modified to work with QB64-PE and may no longer work with anything else
3. Some of these are unmodified as they were written for QB64-PE and are here just as part of the collection
4. If you want the original versions, then follow the links below or search on the internet
5. I will keep updating this repo with new stuff that I can find and fix to work with QB64-PE
6. Help me by contributing, fixing or updating. Pull requests welcome!
